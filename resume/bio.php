	<p>
		Busey Ipsum… All men are failed women at birth. You know when you get the outside genitalia, its like "Oh my god what have they done to me?". You dip it in the horse radish, let it pee it off, dip it in the salsa sauce, one drip and thats it.

	<h3 class="bio-title">What I can do for you</h3>
	<p>
		The best way to communicate is compatible. Compatible communication is listening with open ears and an open mind, and not being fearful or judgemental about what you're hearing. Listen to the silence. And when the silence is deafening, you're in the center of your own universe.
